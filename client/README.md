# TypeScript Client

This React-TS client listens for positional data and shows them to a screen.

## Quick Start

1. Install packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run client

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This makes a Websocket connection request to Port 9002 and renders data on screen.
